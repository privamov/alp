/**
 * Memory profiler.
 *
 * At each call to [[MemoryProfiler.markPhase]] performs garbage collection and stores
 * heap and non-heap memory usage in an external file.
 *
 * <em>Heap memory</em> is the runtime data area from which memory for all
 * class instances and arrays is allocated. <em>Non-heap memory</em> includes
 * the method area and memory required for the internal processing or
 * optimization of the JVM. It stores per-class structures such as a runtime
 * constant pool, field and method data, and the code for methods and
 * constructors. The Java Native Interface (JNI) code or the native library of
 * an application and the JVM implementation allocate memory from the
 * <em>native heap</em>.
 *
 * The script in /devtools/blaze/scripts/blaze-memchart.sh can be used for post processing.
